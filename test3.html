               <h3><a name="bioghist">Agency History</a></h3>
               <p class="bod-in25">The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI) was established by the
                  				6th Texas Legislature as the Asylum for the Blind (Chapter CVIII, August 16, 1856).
                  				In January 1857, the first student was admitted to the institution. The first
                  				classes of students met in a rented residence in Austin. The Asylum for the Blind
                  				eventually moved into a building on 19th Street and East Avenue. This site was
                  				transferred to the University of Texas in 1925, becoming the "Little Campus." The Asylum for the Blind became known
                  				as the Texas Institution for the Blind (also referred to as the Blind Institute)
                  in
                  				1905 and the Texas School for the Blind in 1915. In this latter year, the
                  				legislature appropriated funds to build a new campus on 73 acres of land in
                  				northwest Austin, donated by the citizens. This land, located at 1100 West 45th
                  				Street, was occupied by the school in 1917. In 1919, the 36th Legislature created
                  				the Board of Control (Senate Bill 147, Regular Session). This three-member board
                  				replaced the boards of governors of each of the state's eleemosynary institutions,
                  				including the board of trustees of the School for the Blind. In 1951, the 52nd
                  				Legislature placed the School for the Blind under the Board for Texas State
                  				Hospitals and Special Schools (House Bill 378, Regular Session). The 53rd
                  				Legislature transferred the School for the Blind to the State Board of Education
                  				(Senate Bill 119/House Bill 128, Regular Session). In 1965, the legislature placed
                  				the School for the Blind under the direction of a Central Services Agency for
                  				Special Schools for the Blind and the Deaf, under the State Board of Education,
                  				which became the Texas Education Agency (House Bill 377, 59th Legislature, Regular
                  				Session). The name of the School for the Blind was changed in 1989 to the TSBVI
                  to
                  				better reflect the population it serves. The TSBVI is an independent school
                  				district, which covers kindergarten through twelfth grade education, and provides
                  				residential services for the blind and multihandicapped blind students. TSBVI
                  also
                  				provides technical assistance to teachers, other professionals, and parents in
                  local
                  				Texas communities to better serve blind and visually impaired students in the
                  				students' home districts.</p>
               <p class="bod-in25">Concurrently, visually-impaired African American youths were taught at a similar
                  				institution. In 1887, the 20th Legislature created the Texas Institute for Deaf,
                  				Dumb and Blind Colored Youths, to occupy a 100-acre tract four miles northwest
                  of
                  				the State Capitol, just east of what became Camp Mabry (House Bill 445, 20th
                  				Legislature, Regular Session). The first class had nine blind students and eight
                  				deaf students, taught by one teacher apiece. Enrollment had climbed to 125 by
                  1912,
                  				with a faculty of 11. The governing body was a three-person board of trustees.
                  In
                  				1930, orphans began to be admitted to the newly designated Deaf, Dumb and Blind
                  				Asylum for Colored Youths and Colored Orphans (House Bill 154, 41st Legislature,
                  5th
                  				Called Session). Three more name changes followed: in 1943, to the State School
                  for
                  				Deaf and Blind Negro Children; in 1947, to the Texas Blind, Deaf and Orphan School;
                  				and in 1965, to the Texas Blind and Deaf School (finally placed under the Texas
                  				Education Agency). With desegregation in 1966, black students were merged with
                  white
                  				students in the TSBVI and the Texas School for the Deaf.</p>
               <p class="bod-in25">The TSBVI is overseen by a nine-member board appointed by the governor for
                  				overlapping six-year terms. Public meetings of the board are held five to six
                  times
                  				per year. Three of the members must be blind or visually impaired, three must
                  be
                  				parents of blind or visually impaired persons, and three must have had experience
                  in
                  				working with the blind or visually impaired. The board is the equivalent of the
                  				board of trustees of an independent school district: it appoints an executive
                  				director or superintendent to administer the school, and all actions of the board
                  				may be appealed to the State Board of Education (Texas Education Code, Sections
                  				11.06 through 11.091). The board has three standing committees: audit, compliance,
                  				and management review; finance; and programs.</p>

               <h3><a name="scopecontent">Scope and Contents of the Records</a></h3>
               <p class="bod-in25">The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired is a public school district that
                  				provides specialized services that focus on the unique learning needs of primary
                  and
                  				secondary students with visual impairments, including those with additional
                  				disabilities. Records consist of agenda, minutes and agenda attachments (including
                  				reports, correspondence, policies, and directives) for the meetings of the board
                  of
                  				trustees and date from 1856 to 1919 and 1979 to 2015. Subjects include the results
                  				of student testing, administration of the school district, employee benefits and
                  				expectations, support activities for blind and visually impaired students attending
                  				school in his or her home district, staff policies (leave time and rights),
                  				education policies, and student discipline and welfare policies. Earlier minutes,
                  				dating 1856-1919, apparently complete for the first 64 years of the school's
                  				existence, are handwritten for the 19th century, and typewritten and pasted into
                  the
                  				ledger for the early 20th century. In addition to minutes, these earlier minutes
                  				contain regulations, duties, and inventories of property. Agenda inform the public
                  				as to what will be discussed and/or decided at each meeting. Minutes document
                  in a
                  				thorough but summary fashion the official actions of the board in its meetings.
                  				Researchers should note that minutes are approved at the following meeting, so
                  				records document the business of the previous meeting.</p>
               <p class="bod-in25">To prepare this inventory, the described materials were cursorily reviewed to
                  				delineate series, to confirm the accuracy of contents lists, to provide an estimate
                  				of dates covered, and to determine record types.</p>
